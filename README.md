## Description
 This is a project to develop a Real Estate Price Prediction system.
 Our Motive is to  demonstrate the usage of machine learning algorithms in the prediction of Real estate/House prices on real datasets.
 To this day, literature about research on machine learning prediction of house prices in India is extremely limited.
 This project provides a review of the usage of existing machine learning algorithms on  extremely different
 datasets and tries to implement this prediction engine for real-life usage by users.
 The findings indicate that using different algorithms can drastically change accuracy. 
 Also, a poor dataset can negatively affect the predictions. Furthermore, it provides sufficient proof of what algorithm is best suitable for this task.
 The primary aim of this project is to use these Machine Learning Techniques and curate them into ML models which can then serve the users. 
 The main objective of a Buyer is to search for their dream house which has all the amenities they need. 
 Furthermore, they look for these houses/Real estates with a price in mind and there is no guarantee that they will get the product for a deserving price and not overpriced. 
 Similarly, A seller looks for a certain number that they can put on the estate as a price tag and this cannot be just a wild guess, lots of research needs to be put to conclude a valuation of a house.
